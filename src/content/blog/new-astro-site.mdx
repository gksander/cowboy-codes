Well here's some code, suppose `my_variable` is some number.

```ts twoslash
const double = (x: number) => x + x;

const myDoubledNumber = double(3);
//    ^?

// Shits and giggles
console.log(myDoubledNumber, "Hello world");
```

What about some rust?

```rust
fn double(x: i32) -> i32 {
  x + x
}
```
